performance in multithreading
    Latency : the time to completion of a task. measured in time units.
    Throughput : The amount of tasks completed in a given period. measured in tasks/time unit

Latency
[=========Task=============]
<-------Latency=T---------->

[=Task1=]
[=Task2=]
...
[=TaskN=]
<--Latency=T/N-->

Theoretical reduction of latency by N = performance improvement by a factor of N.

Can not break any task into subtasks
