conditions for deadlocks
    Mutual Execution : Only one thread can have exclusive access to resource
    Hold & Wait : At least one thread is holding a resource and waiting for other resource
    Non-preemptive allocation : A resource is released only after the thread is done using it.
    Circular wait : A chain of at least two threads each one is holding one resource and waiting for another resource

solution for deadlocks
    Avoid Circular wait - Enforce a strict order in lock acquisition

Other techniques for resolve deadlocks
    Deadlock detection : watchdog
    Thread interruption (not possible with synchronized)
    tryLock operations (not possible with synchronized)

Locking strategies
    Coarse-grained locking (loch entire block using synchronized) : not good for high performance
    Fine-grained locking - gives better parallelism but cause to deadlocks

Resolve deadlocks :
    solved by avoiding circular wait and hold
    Lock resources in the same order, everywhere
