thread pooling reduced time for create threads
it creates threads initially and use when they need
JDM comes with built-in thead pool with queue(tasks will added to this queue and starts process when thread free)

int numOfThreads = 4;
Executor executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfThreads);
Runnable task = .... // some codes
executor.execute(task); // this line will add task to queue

using fixed thread pool, we maintain constant number of threads, and eliminate the need to recreate the threads
