head is a shared memory region that belongs to the process
all the threads shared data available in heap

what is allocated on the heap?
    Objects(anything created with the new operator)
        String,Object,Collection,...
    Members of classes
    static variables


Heap is governed and managed by Garbage Collector
Objects : stay as long as we have a reference to them
Members of classes : stay as long as we have a reference to them
Static variables : stay forever

References != Objects

Object referenceVar1 = new Object();
Object referenceVar2 = referenceVar1; // here not creating new object and pointing same heap object

References
    can be allocated on the stack
    can be allocated on the heap if they are members of a class

Objects
    always allocated on the heap
