Stack is memory region where
    methods are called
    arguments are passed
    local variables are stored


stack + instruction pointer = state of each thread's execution


stack's properties
    all variables belong to the thread executing on that stack
    statically allocated when the thread is created
    the stack's size is fixed,a nd relatively small ( platform specific )
    if our calling hierarchy is too deep, we may get a StackOverFlow Exception.(risky with recursive calls)
